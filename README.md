# Log_Parser
A log parser

We have to build a log parser that parse the whole log file.
The log file is added in ebs_log_parser/orgdata/access_log.
See the pattern in this file and using regex filter the important data (like IP, TimeStamp, Request Type, Status code(i.e 200), others urls).

# To run the project 
* go to cd Log_Parser/ebs_log_parser/
* uninstall node_modules folder and package-lock.json file
* run "npm install" in on terminal
* run "npm start" to run the project
* Open the browser and paste "http://localhost:8080/"
